  "about.glossary": "<h3 class=\"section__head\">Complexity</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">The concept of complexity is central to Prospedia because the routes to the prosperity of a society depend on firms to successfully produce and export goods and services that require skills and knowledge that are diverse and unique. Complexity can be measured by location (see <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"#economic-complexity-index\">Economic Complexity Index</a>), by industry (see <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"#industry-complexity-index\">Industry Complexity Index</a>) or by export product (see <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"#product-complexity-index\">Product Complexity Index</a>).</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Complexity Outlook</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Ranks the potential for a location to increase its complexity. The ranking accounts for the level of complexity of the industries (or exports) along with the distance of how close the productive capabilities that these products require are to its current industries (or exports). In effect, it measures the likelihood of different industries (or exports) appearing and the value of their added complexity. Higher outlook values indicate \u201ccloser distance\u201d to more, and more complex, industries (or exports).</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Distance</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of a location\u2019s ability to enter a specific industry or export, as determined by its current productive capabilities. Also known as a capability distance, the measure accounts for the similarity between the capabilities required by an industry or export and the capabilities already present in a location\u2019s industries or exports. Where a new industry or export requires many of the same capabilities already present in a location\u2019s industries or exports, the product is considered \u201ccloser\u201d or of a shorter \u201cdistance\u201d to acquire the missing capabilities to produce it. New industries or exports of a further distance require larger sets of productive capabilities that do not exist in the location and are therefore riskier ventures or less likely to be sustained. Thus, distance reflects the proportion of the productive knowledge necessary for an industry or export that a location does not have. This is measured by the proximity between industries or exports, or the probability that two industries or exports will both be present in a location, as embodied by the industry space and product space, respectively.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"economic-complexity-index\">Economic Complexity Index (ECI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of the sophistication of the productive capabilities of a location based on the diversity and exclusivity of its industries or exports. A location with high complexity produces or exports goods and services that few other locations produce. Highly complex locations tend to be more productive and generate higher wages and incomes. Countries with export baskets more sophisticated than what is expected for their income level (such as China) tend to grow faster than those where the opposite is true (such as Greece).</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"industry-complexity-index\">Industry Complexity Index (ICI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Ranks industries by the amount of productive capabilities required to operate. The complexity of industries and exports are closely related, but are measured through independent datasets and classification systems as exports are limited to only tradable sectors, while industries comprise all sectors that generate employment, including the public sector. Industries are complex when they require a sophisticated level of productive knowledge, such as many financial services and pharmaceutical industries, with many individuals with distinct specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. Complexity of the industry is measured by calculating the average diversity of locations that hold the industry and the average ubiquity of the industries that those locations hold. The formal employment data required for these calculations comes from the PILA dataset held by the Ministry of Health.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Formal employment and wages, and formal employment rate</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Formal employment is defined as employment covered by the health social security system and/or the pension system. Formal wages are those reported by firms to that aim. The formality rate is the share of population 15 or older that has formal employment. Employment and wage data are taken from PILA. Population data comes from DANE.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Industry similarity space</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A visualization that depicts how similar/dissimilar the productive knowledge requirements are between industries. Each dot represents an industry and each link between a pair of industries indicates that they require similar productive capabilities to operate. The space illustrates what industries a location currently has a presence in, and which industries are of a \u201ccloser distance\u201d or require similar capabilities to those existing and are therefore more likely to be successful. The space presents potential paths for industrial expansion by understanding how capabilities are shared across industries. Thus, industries can be understood by the number of links they share with other products and the complexity of those products. A product with more links offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus the number of links that existing industries share to untapped, complex industries determines its complexity outlook. The Colombian industry similarity space is based on formal employment data by industry and municipality from the PILA dataset of the Ministry of Health.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Metropolitan areas and cities</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A metropolitan area is a combination of two or more municipalities that are connected through relatively large commuting flows (irrespective of their size or contiguity). A municipality must send at least 10% of its workers as daily commuters to the rest of the metropolitan area municipalities to be included. </p> <p class=\"section__p\">Based on this definition there are 19 metropolitan areas in Colombia, which comprise 115 municipalities. The resulting metro areas, which are distinct from official measures except in Medell\u00edn\u2019s Valle de Aburr\u00e1, are computed with the methodology of Duranton and Giles (2013): \u201cDelineating metropolitan areas: Measuring spatial labour market networks through commuting patterns.\u201d Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">In addition to the metropolitan areas there are other 43 cities in Colombia, defined as municipalities with population over 50,000, with at least 75% of the population in the main urban area.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"product-complexity-index\">Product Complexity Index (PCI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Ranks export products by the amount of productive capabilities required to manufacture them. A product such as toothpaste is much more than paste in a tube, as it embeds the tacit productive knowledge (or knowhow) of the chemicals that kill the germs that cause cavities and gum disease. Complex exports, which include many chemical and machinery products, require a sophisticated level, and diverse base, of productive knowledge, with many individuals with distinct specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. This contrasts with low complexity exports, like coffee, which require much less basic productive knowledge that can be found in a family-run business. <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"http://comtrade.un.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Comtrade</a> data are used to compute the complexity of export products.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Product similarity space</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A visualization that depicts how similar/dissimilar the productive knowledge requirements are between export products. Each dot represents a product and each link between a pair of products indicates that the two products require similar capabilities in their production. By depicting the similarity in productive capabilities across products, the product similarity space illustrates for a location what it currently produces, which products are \u201ccloser\u201d or of a shorter distance in sharing similar capabilities to those currently existing and are therefore more likely to be successful. The space presents potential paths for industrial expansion by understanding how capabilities are shared across products, where products differ in the number of links and their distance to more complex products. A product with more links offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus the number of links that existing products share to complex products that a location does not currently produce determines the complexity outlook of its exports.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">The shape of the space is based on international trade data for 192 countries over 50 years. See <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"> The International Atlas of Economic Complexity.</a></p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Strategic Value</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Measures how much a location could benefit by developing a particular industry (or export). Also known also as \u201copportunity gain,\u201d the measure accounts for the distance to all other industries (or exports) that a location does not currently produce and their respective complexity. Strategic gain quantifies how a new industry (or export) can open up links to more, and more complex, products. Thus, the measure calculates the strategic value of an industry (or export) based on the paths it opens to industrial expansion into more complex sectors.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Measures the relative size of an industry or an export product in a location. RCA is not a measure of productive efficiency or competitiveness, but just a \u201clocation quotient\u201d, as is often referred to. RCA is computed as the ratio between an industry\u2019s share of total formal employment in a location and the share of that industry\u2019s total formal employment in the country. For exports, RCA is the ratio between the share of the export in the export basket of the location and its share in total world trade. If this ratio is larger than 1, the location is said to have revealed comparative advantage in the industry or export.</p>",

CID is Harvard\u2019s leading research hub focusing on resolving the dilemmas of public policy associated with generating stable, shared, and sustainable prosperity in developing countries. The Growth Lab is one of CID\u2019s core research programs. Faculty and fellows work to understand the dynamics of growth and to translate those insights into more effective policymaking in developing countries. The Lab places economic complexity and diversification at the center of the development story and uncovers how countries and cities can move into industries with potential to increase productivity.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">Economic Complexity is a measure of the amount of productive capabilities, or knowhow, that a country or a city has. Products are vehicles for knowledge. To make a shirt, one must design it, produce the fabric, cut it, sew it, pack it, market it and distribute it. For a country to produce shirts, it needs people who have expertise in each of these areas. Each of these tasks involves many more capabilities than any one person can master. Only by combining know-how from different people can any one product be made. The road to economic development involves increasing what a society knows how to do. Countries with more productive capabilities can make a greater diversity of products. Economic growth occurs when countries develop the capabilities and productive knowledge to produce more, and more complex, products.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">This research has been applied at the international level in an online tool, The Atlas of Economic Complexity. By partnering with Colombia, the lab has been able to investigate export and industry possibilities at the sub-national level.</p> </section> <section class=\"stream__section\"> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Founding Partners</h3> <h4 class=\"section__subhead\">Mario Santo Domingo Foundation</h4> <p class=\"section__p\">Created in 1953, the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation (FMSD) is a non-profit organization dedicated to implementing community development programs in Colombia. FMSD decided to concentrate its main efforts in the construction of affordable housing within a Community Development Model, named Integral Development of Sustainable Communities (DINCS in its Spanish initials) and designed by the FMSD as a response to the large housing deficit in Colombia. Through this program, the FMSD delivers social support for families, and social infrastructure and urban development for the less privileged. FMSD also supports entrepreneurs in the Northern region of Colombia and in Bogot\u00e1 through its Microfinance Unit which provides training and financial services such as microcredit. More than 130,000 entrepreneurs have received loans from the Foundation since its launch in 1984.
