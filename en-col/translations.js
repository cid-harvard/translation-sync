  "about.glossary": "<p class=\"section__p\">See page \"About the data\" for further information about sources, computational methods of the complexity variables and downloadable databases.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"cities \">Cities</h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> A city is a metropolitan area or a municipality with more than 50,000 inhabitants, 75% of whom reside in the main urban location (cabecera). There are 62 cities (19 metropolitan areas comprising 115 municipalities, plus 43 other cities of just one municipality). The concept of city is relevant because Datlas presents complexity indicators by department and city, but not by municipality.</p><h3 class=\"section__head\">Complexity</h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> Complexity is the amount and sophistication of knowhow required to produce something. The concept of complexity is central to Datlas because productivity and growth everywhere depend on firms to successfully produce and export goods and services that require skills and knowledge that are diverse and unique. Complexity can be measured by location, by industry or by export product.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Complexity Outlook</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Measures the potential of a location to reach higher complexity levels. The measure accounts for the level of complexity of the industries (or exports) along with the distance of how close the productive capabilities that these industries require are to its current industries (or exports). More specifically, it measures the likelihood of different industries (or exports) appearing and the value of their added complexity. Higher outlook values indicate \u201ccloser distance\u201d to more, and more complex, industries (or exports). </p> <p class=\"section__p\"> Industry complexity outlook values are computed for departments and cities, not for the rest of municipalities. Export complexity outlook values are computed for departments and cities with at least 50 dollars of exports per capita (below this threshold export baskets are unstable and/or lack representativeness). </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">DANE</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">DANE is the National Statistical Office. It is the source of all data on GDP and population used by Datlas. </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">DIAN</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">DIAN is the National Tax and Customs Authority. It is the source of all data on exports and imports by department and municipality in Datlas.<p class=\"section__p\"> </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Distance</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of a location\u2019s ability to enter a specific industry or export, as determined by its current productive capabilities. Also known as a capability distance, the measure accounts for the similarity between the capabilities required by an industry or export and the capabilities already present in a location\u2019s industries or exports. Where a new industry or export requires many of the same capabilities already present in a location\u2019s industries or exports, the product is considered \u201ccloser\u201d or of a shorter \u201cdistance\u201d to acquire the missing capabilities to produce it. New industries or exports of a further distance require larger sets of productive capabilities that do not exist in the location and are therefore riskier ventures or less likely to be sustained. Thus, distance reflects the proportion of the productive knowledge necessary for an industry or export that a location does not have. This is measured by the proximity between industries or exports, or the probability that two industries or exports will both be present in a location, as embodied by the industry space and product space, respectively.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">Industry distance values are computed for departments and cities, but not for the rest of municipalities. Export distance values are computed for departments and cities with at least 50 dollars of exports per capita (below this threshold export baskets are unstable and/or lack representativeness). </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"diversity \">Diversity</h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> A measure of how many different types of products a place is able to produce. The production of a good requires a specific set of know-how; therefore, a country\u2019s total diversity is another way of expressing the amount of collective know-how that a place has.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"economic-complexity-index\">Economic Complexity Index (ECI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of the sophistication of the productive capabilities of a location based on the diversity and ubiquity of its industries or exports. A location with high complexity produces or exports goods and services that few other locations produce. Highly complex locations tend to be more productive and generate higher wages and incomes. Countries with export baskets more sophisticated than what is expected for their income level (such as China) tend to grow faster than those where the opposite is true (such as Greece).</p> <p class=\"section__p\">Industry ECI values are computed for departments and cities, but not for the rest of municipalities. Export ECI values are computed for departments and cities with at least 50 dollars of exports per capita (below this threshold export baskets are unstable and/or lack representativeness). </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Formal employment and wages, and formal employment rate</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Formal employment is defined as employment covered by the health social security system and/or the pension system. The self-employed are not included. Formal wages are those reported by firms to that aim. Formal employment reported is the number of formal employees in an average month. Formality rate is defined as formal employment divided by population older than 15. Employment and wage data are taken from PILA. Population data comes from DANE. </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"industry-complexity-index\">Industry Complexity Index (ICI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of the amount of productive capabilities that an industry requires to operate. The ICI and the Product Complexity Index (PCI) are closely related, but are measured through independent datasets and classification systems as the PCI is computed only for internationally tradable goods, while the ICI is calculated for all industries that generate formal employment, including the public sector. Industries are complex when they require a sophisticated level of productive knowledge, such as many financial services and pharmaceutical industries, with many individuals with distinct specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. Complexity of the industry is measured by calculating the average diversity of locations that hold the industry and the average ubiquity of the industries that those locations hold. The formal employment data required for these calculations comes from the PILA dataset held by the Ministry of Health. </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Industry classification system</h3><p class=\"section__p\">Colombia\u2019s industry classification system is a modified version of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC). Datlas shows industry information at two- and four-digit level. All industry data come from PILA. Following national accounting conventions, workers hired by temporary employment firms are classified in the labor recruitment industry (7491), not in the industry of the firm where they physically work.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Industry technological similarity space (or industry space)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A visualization that depicts how similar/dissimilar the productive knowledge requirements are between industries. Each dot represents an industry and each link between a pair of industries indicates that they require similar productive capabilities to operate. Colored dots are industries with revealed comparative advantage larger than one. When an industry is selected, the map shows the industries that require similar productive capabilities. An industry with more links offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus the number of links that existing industries share to untapped, complex industries determines the complexity outlook of the location. The Colombian industry similarity space is based on formal employment data by industry and municipality from the PILA dataset of the Ministry of Health.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Metropolitan area</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A metropolitan area is a combination of two or more municipalities that are connected through relatively large commuting flows (irrespective of their size or contiguity). A municipality must send at least 10% of its workers as daily commuters to the rest of the metropolitan area municipalities to be included. </p> <p class=\"section__p\">Based on this definition there are 19 metropolitan areas in Colombia, which comprise 115 municipalities. The resulting metro areas, which are distinct from official measures, are computed with the methodology of G. Duranton (2013): \u201cDelineating metropolitan areas: Measuring spatial labour market networks through commuting patterns.\u201d Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Occupations </h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> Occupations are classified according to the Occupational Information Network Numerical Index (ONET). All data on occupations (wages offered by occupation, occupational structure by industry, and education level required by occupation) come from job vacancy announcements placed by firms in public and private Internet job sites during 2014. The data were processed by Jeisson Arley C\u00e1rdenas Rubio (Universidad del Rosario, Bogot\u00e1) and Jaime Mauricio Monta\u00f1a Doncel (Paris School of Economics). </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Opportunity gain </h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> Measures how much a location could benefit by developing a particular industry (or export). Also known also as \u201cstrategic value,\u201d the measure accounts for the distances to all other industries (or exports) that a location does not currently produce with revealed comparative advantage larger than one and their respective complexities. Opportunity gain quantifies how a new industry (or export) can open up links to more, and more complex, products. Thus, the measure calculates the value of an industry (or export) based on the paths it opens to industrial expansion into more complex sectors. </p> <p class=\"section__p\">Industry opportunity gain values are computed for departments and cities, but not for the rest of municipalities. Export opportunity gain values are computed for departments and cities with at least 50 dollars of exports per capita (below this threshold export baskets are unstable and/or lack representativeness). </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">PILA </h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> PILA is the Integrated Report of Social Security Contributions, managed by the Ministry of Health. It is the main source of industry data. It contains information on formal employment, wages and number of firms by municipality and industry.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"product-complexity-index\">Product Complexity Index (PCI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> Measures the amount of productive capabilities required to manufacture a product. Complex exports, which include many chemical and machinery products, require a sophisticated level, and diverse base, of productive knowledge, with many individuals with distinct specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. This contrasts with low complexity exports, like coffee, which require much less basic productive knowledge that can be found in a family-run business. <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"http://comtrade.un.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Comtrade</a> data are used to compute the complexity of export products.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Product technological similarity space (or product space)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A visualization that depicts how similar/dissimilar the productive knowledge requirements are between export products. Each dot represents a product and each link between a pair of products indicates that the two products require similar capabilities in their production. Colored dots are exports with revealed comparative advantage larger than one. When a product is selected, the map shows the products that require similar productive capabilities. A product with more links offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus the number of links that existing products share to complex products that a location does not currently produce determines the complexity outlook of its exports.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">The shape of the space is based on international trade data for 192 countries over 50 years. See <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"> The International Atlas of Economic Complexity.</a></p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Measures the relative size of an industry or an export product in a location. RCA is not a measure of productive efficiency or competitiveness, but just a \u201clocation quotient\u201d, as is often referred to. RCA is computed as the ratio between an industry\u2019s share of total formal employment in a location and the share of that industry\u2019s total formal employment in Colombia as a whole. For instance, if the chemical industry generates10% of a city\u2019s employment, while it generates only 1% of total employment in Colombia, the RCA of the industry in the city is 10. For exports, RCA is the ratio between the share of the export in the export basket of the location and its share in total world trade. If this ratio is larger than 1, the location is said to have revealed comparative advantage in the industry or export. For instance, if a department\u2019s coffee exports are 30% of its exports but coffee accounts for just 0.3% of world trade, the department\u2019s RCA in coffee is 100.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"ubiquity \">Ubiquity</h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> A measure of the number of places that are able to make a product.</p>",

  "about.project_description.intro.p3": "Economic complexity is a measure of the amount of productive capabilities, or knowhow, that a country or a city has. Products are vehicles for knowledge. To make a shirt, one must design it, produce the fabric, cut it, sew it, pack it, market it and distribute it. For a country to produce shirts, it needs people who have expertise in each of these areas. Each of these tasks involves many more capabilities than any one person can master. Only by combining know-how from different people can any one product be made. The road to economic development involves increasing what a society knows how to do. Countries with more productive capabilities can make a greater diversity of products. Economic growth occurs when countries develop the capabilities and productive knowledge to produce more, and more complex, products.",

In the case of petroleum oil (2709) and gas (2711), total export values were distributed by origin according to production by municipality (sources: Hydrocarbons National Agency and Colombian Petroleum Association), and in the case of oil refined products (2710), according to value added by municipality (industries 2231, 2322 y 2320 SIIC revision 3, Annual Manufacturing Survey, DANE). </p>\u00a0<p class=\"section__p\">Export totals by product may not correspond to official data because the following are excluded: (a) exports lacking information on the industry of the exporter and/or the department or municipality of origin, and (b) exports for which DIAN reports free zones as the place of destination; while the following are included: (c) exports from free zones, which DIAN does not include in those export totals. </p> <p class=\"section__p\">In a similar fashion, import totals by product may not correspond to official data because the following are excluded: (a) imports lacking information on the department or municipality of destination, and (b) imports for which DIAN reports free zones as the place of origin; while the following are included: (c) imports done by free zones, which DIAN does not include in those import totals. <p class=\"section__p\">A file that describes the correspondence between the HS version used by DIAN and HS 1992 can be found <a style=\"color: #53534f; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/datlas-colombia-downloads/production/HS_Corresp_2012_1992.xlsx\">here</a>.</p> Included <a style=\"color: #53534f; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/datlas-colombia-downloads/production/codes_not_in_product_space.xlsx\">here</a> is a file with the list of products in the Harmonized System that are not represented in the product space (for reasons explained in \"Calculation Methods\").",
