  "about.glossary": "<h3 class=\"section__head\">Complexity</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Economic complexity is important because prosperity implies having firms able to produce and export goods and services that require diverse skills and knowledge. Complexity can be measured by location industry or exports .</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Complexity Outlook</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Ranks the potential for a location to increase its economic complexity. The ranking accounts for the level of complexity of the industries (or exports) already present, and the distance in terms of skills and knowledge that separate them from other industries (exports). In practice, it measures the likelihood of different industries (exports) appearing and the value of their added complexity. Higher outlook values indicate \u201ccloser distance\u201d to more complex industries (exports).</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Distance</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of a location\u2019s ability to conquer a specific industry (or export), as determined by its current productive capabilities. It accounts for the similarity between the capabilities required by an industry (or export) and the capabilities already present in a location. Where a new industry or export requires many of the same capabilities already present in a location, the product is considered \u201ccloser\u201d or \"at a shorter distance\u201d. New industries or exports at further distance require larger sets of productive capabilities that do not exist in the location and are therefore riskier ventures. Thus, distance reflects the proportion of the productive knowledge required by an industry or export that a location does not have. </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"economic-complexity-index\">Economic Complexity Index (ECI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A measure of the sophistication of the productive capabilities of a location based on the diversity and exclusivity of its industries (or exports). A location with high complexity is able to produce goods and services that few other locations can produce. Highly complex locations tend to be more productive and generate higher wages and incomes. Countries with export baskets more sophisticated than what is expected for their income level, tend to grow faster than those where the opposite is true.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"industry-complexity-index\">Industry Complexity Index (ICI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Ranks industries by the diversity and uniqueness of productive skills and capabilities it requires. The complexity of industries and exports are closely related, but are measured through independent datasets and classification systems. Exports only comprise tradable sectors (using the Harmonized System of product classification, 1992 revision), while industries contain all sectors that generate employment (using the Mexican version of the North American Industry Classification System -NAICS-, 2007 revision). Also, a single industry may be able to produce and export different products. Industries are complex when they require a sophisticated level of productive knowledge. Industry complexity is measured by calculating the average diversity of locations that hold the industry and the average ubiquity of the industries that those locations hold. The formal employment data required for these calculations comes from aggregating Social Security data at the industry-location level.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Formal employment and wages, and formal employment rate</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Formal employment by industry is defined as employment covered by the social security system. Wages are those reported by firms to that aim. The formal employment and wagebill estimates use information from those firms to which a clear industry code (NAICS 2007) can be imputed. Since the Mexican Atlas of Economic Complexity does not include information from all firms affiliated to the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), totals across sectors in the Mexican Atlas of Economic Complexity should not be interpreted as the totals of formal employment and wagebill, either at a national or a subnational level. To ascertain such totals, please refer to the IMSS open data page (http://busca.datos.gob.mx/#/conjuntos/asegurados-en-el-imss). Population data comes from INEGI.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Industry similarity space</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A visualization that depicts how similar are the knowledge and skills required by different industries. Each color represents a different sector, dots represent industries within that sector, and each link between a pair of industries indicates that both require similar capabilities and skills. The space also illustrates (filled dots) what industries exhibit a relative comparative advantage (RCA), and how close they are from industries that are not present at that location. The industry space represents potential paths for industrial expansion by understanding how capabilities are shared across industries. Thus, industries can be understood by the number of links they share with others and the complexity of those industries. An industry with more links offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. The Mexican industry similarity space is based on formal employment data by industry and municipality coming from IMSS.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Metropolitan areas</h3> <p class=\"section__p\"> The definition of Metropolitan areas follows the guidelines established in 2004 by CONAPO, INEGI and SEDESOL: 1) the group of two or more municipalities, in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or, under its area of direct influence, other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities, all of which either have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or 2) a single municipality, in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained without transcending the limits of a single municipality; or 3) a city with a population of at least 250,000 that forms a conurbation with other cities in the United States. </p> <h3 class=\"section__head\" id=\"product-complexity-index\">Product Complexity Index (PCI)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Ranks export products by the diversity and uniqueness of productive skills and capabilities it requires. A product such as toothpaste is much more than paste in a tube, as it embeds the tacit productive knowledge (or knowhow) of the chemicals that kill the germs that cause cavities and gum disease. Complex exports, which include many chemical and machinery products, require a sophisticated level, and diverse base, of productive knowledge, with many individuals with distinct specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. This contrasts with low complexity exports, like coffee, which require much less basic productive knowledge that can be found in a family-run business. <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"http://comtrade.un.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Comtrade</a> data are used to compute the complexity of export products.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Product similarity space</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">A visualization that depicts how similar are the knowledge and skills required by different export products. Each color represents a different sector, dots represent export products within that sector, and each link between a pair of products indicates that both require similar capabilities and skills. The space also illustrates (filled dots) where does the location exhibits relative comparative advantages (RCA), and how close they are from export products where it does not. The space represents potential paths for export expansion by understanding how capabilities are shared across products. Thus, products can be understood by the number of links they share with other products and the complexity of those products. A product with more links offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus the number of links that existing products share to complex products that a location does not currently produce determines the complexity outlook of its exports.</p> <p class=\"section__p\">The shape of the space is based on international trade data for 192 countries over 50 years. See <a class=\"link--stream\" href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"> The International Atlas of Economic Complexity.</a></p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Strategic Value</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Measures how much a location could benefit by developing a particular industry (or export). Also known also as \u201copportunity gain,\u201d the measure accounts for the distance to all other industries (or exports) that a location does not currently produce and their respective complexity. Strategic gain quantifies how a new industry (or export) can open up links to more, and more complex, products. Thus, the measure calculates the strategic value of an industry (or export) based on the paths it opens to industrial expansion into more complex sectors.</p> <h3 class=\"section__head\">Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)</h3> <p class=\"section__p\">Measures the relative size of an industry or an export product in a location. RCA is not a measure of productive efficiency or competitiveness, but just a \u201clocation quotient\u201d, as is often referred to. RCA is computed as the ratio between an industry\u2019s share of total formal employment in a location and the share of that industry\u2019s total formal employment in the country. For exports, RCA is the ratio between the share of the export in the export basket of the location and its share in total world trade. If this ratio is larger than 1, the location is said to have revealed comparative advantage in the industry or export.</p>",

For a country to produce shirts, it needs people who have expertise in each of these areas. Each of these tasks involves many more capabilities than any one person can master. Only by combining know-how from different people can any one product be made. The road to economic development involves increasing what a society knows how to do. Countries with more productive capabilities can make a greater diversity of products. Economic growth occurs when countries develop the capabilities and productive knowledge to produce more, and more complex, products.",
